# Game Development / Capstone Project Proposal
- **Name**: Meili Zheng
- **Year and Qtr**: 6th quarter
- **Additional Teammate (If working in team)**: 
## Introduction:
- Provide context and motivations of the project.
- Use MERN to create a game
- Why did you decide to work on this project?
- Before I was thinking to create a create a booking app or dashboard, but since this quarter I chose the game class, so I want to use the knowleg that I will learn from class to create a game, the reason why I change my mind is because game is a new field for me and I want to learn more and improve my skill.
- What are your goals for this project?
- My gola for this project is to learn the logic that is behind the game, and try to build my own game, maybe for my kids.:)
- What do you project your final project will look like?
- I simple game for kids that will help them learn thing like math during they play the game.
- What are the specific features you deem required to implement for this
- 
project?
- What are features that you would like to implement if given the time?
- sound and 
- (Pre-project)
- How difficult do you think this project will be?
- For right now, since I don't have too much knowleg about the game, I can just think the easy part, like maybe a stuff(person or animal move) then add some choice let the user to click or choose, if correct add some points to the user.
- What skills do you plan to develop with this project that will be useful for
your job search?
Increase knoweldge in javascript, game development, package management with node, continual depoyment with github, animation, modeling, textures, shaders, etc...
- What is the industry like for this kind of application (such as mobile
application, web development, data analysis, etc.)?
  Maybe a app or a web.
## Process Overview:
- Mention tools and artifacts used, such as version control and task managers.
- Languages
- Javascript
Possibly Python
- Frameworks
- Libraries
- Version Control
- GitHub
- Systems you will deploy on (VR, Web, Mobile (Specifically Mac or Windows),
Cross-Platform, etc.)
I will deploy it on Windows.
- Resources that you have found that you will use ( This isn't set in stone )
- Websites
- YouTube Videos
- Explain team roles and procedures.
- If working with someone else, what are the roles you both plan to have?
- What features and functions will you both plan to work on?
- This should be an equal distribution of responsibility. I will be grading
per individual and if someone is pulling the weight of the other, I will grade
accordingly. Also, reach out to me if this appears to be an issue.
## Requirements:
- What are the features that you plan to implement?
- Note: Reach out to me if you need help defining what kind of features you
would like to implement, how to achieve them, and if they are robust enough for
this class.
- Note: I will reach out to you if your project needs to be expanded upon. This
is meant to be a showcase of skills and something to demonstrate at an interview.
## Project Timeline:
Week 0 : Already ahead by working through the Three.js journey (TJJ) tutorial. Already done with the basics on onto the advanced course
Week 1 : Map out the goals that I want to achieve during the project and how I want my students to benefit from my knowledge by creating interactive lessons for them. Most intimidating week.
Week 2 : Work thru Chapter 2 of the TJJ course. This should conclude with an incresed knowledge of the lighting system, shadows, particles, and animated scroll ( this really excites me ). I will demonstrate knowledge in this by creating 1 to two modules for the game dev class.
Goal: Module to introduce basic geometry and models
Week 3 : Continue TJJ. Advanced concepts. Implement concepts.
Import 3d models ( already done)
Raycasting interactions
Physics
Environment Mapping
Realistic Rendering ( Unsure for a game dev module )
Learning how to structure larger projects
This would be a huge push into making interactive apps.
Goal : Create a module that introduces game controls
Week 4 : Continue TJJ.
Goal : Have a physics based lesson online to introduce rigid body concepts
Week 5 :
Start TJJ Shaders chapter, longest chapter. Get though 1 /3 rd
Rest Week for Class
Goal: Introduce materials ( textures, maps, etc... )
Week 6 :
Continue TJJ Shaders. Get though 1 /3 rd
etc...

Week 11 : Demonstration

- Provide a timeline overview, possibly as a Gantt chart or sequential list of
milestones.
- Map out your idea for weekly project on your project.
- This is just a rough idea of how you plan to implement each feature
over the quarter.
- This isn't set in stone. You will find out quickly somethings can be
done in 1 day, and others take weeks. But this is a plan for you to try to follow.
- Your will update your weekly progress about this in teams.
- Describe key phases and interesting details about each phase.
- Examples for this are (Your big features)
- Combining front end and back end
- Implementing Database
- Learning how to deploy your project online
- Implementing your control system in your game
- etc.
## Future Work:
- Discuss potential new features or improvements for future versions.
- What are features that you would like to implement, but are beyond the 3-
month mark?
- Address any originally planned features not implemented and reasons behind it.
